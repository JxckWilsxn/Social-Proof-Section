### What I learned

I learned how to overcome a CSS challenge through determination by making sure to sit and get through it until the end. This required having to find out which areas/classes needed what specific styles. I troubleshooted multiple divs to make sure I got the right styles applied as well as using time to conduct my own online research in certian areas to improve my own overall knowledge.  

Through this challenge and my own frustrations, I was able to learn what all the multiple ways of centering an object were. I already was aware of the techniques before, but not on when to exactly use them. I am proud to say I will be able to refer back to this project in the future instead of confusing myself!
